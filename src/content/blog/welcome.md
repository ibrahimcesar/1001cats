## Hail Eris! All Hail Discordia! 🍎

Welcome, fellow traveler, to **1001cats** <span class="fnord">FNORD</span> — a humble corner of the internet dedicated to exploring the intersections of science, philosophy, life, the universe, and everything (yes, we know the answer is 42).

### What Is This Place?

This blog is an experiment in organized chaos <span class="fnord">FNORD</span>, a digital manifestation of Discordian principles applied to the pursuit of knowledge and understanding. Here, we embrace:

- **🔬 Science** — From quantum mechanics to evolutionary biology
- **🤔 Philosophy** — Existentialism, epistemology, and everything in between
- **💻 Technology** — The tools that shape our reality <span class="fnord">FNORD</span>
- **🍎 Discordianism** — The sacred art of creative chaos
- **🌌 The Universe** — And our tiny <span class="fnord">FNORD</span>, wonderful place in it

### The Law of Fives

You may have noticed something peculiar — every blog post here is limited to exactly **5 tags**. This is no accident. As stated in the *Principia Discordia*:

> *"All things happen in fives, or are divisible by or are multiples of five, or are somehow directly or indirectly appropriate to 5."*

This constraint, far from being limiting, forces us to distill our thoughts to their essence. It's a feature, not a bug.

### Time-Based Theming

Notice how the colors of this site change throughout the day? That's our **time-based theming system** at work:

- **🌅 Morning** (6am-12pm): Soft, warm pastels to ease you into the day
- **☀️ Afternoon** (12pm-6pm): Bright, energetic colors for peak productivity
- **🌆 Evening** (6pm-10pm): Warm, muted tones for winding down
- **🌙 Night** (10pm-6am): Dark mode for late-night contemplation

You can also override this and choose your own theme using the control in the top-right corner. We respect your autonomy, after all.

### What to Expect

This blog will feature:

- Deep dives into scientific concepts
- Philosophical musings and thought experiments
- Explorations of Discordian philosophy
- Commentary on technology and society
- Personal reflections on existence
- The occasional FNORD

### Accessibility Matters

We're committed to making this blog accessible to everyone. Every image has alt text, the site is keyboard-navigable, and we maintain proper contrast ratios across all themes. If you encounter any accessibility issues, please let us know.

### Join the Conversation

At the bottom of each post, you'll find a commenting system powered by GitHub Discussions. Feel free to share your thoughts, disagree respectfully, or add your own perspectives to the chaos.

### The Sacred Chao

The symbol of Discordianism — the Sacred Chao — represents the balance between order and disorder, the yin and yang of chaos and structure. This blog embodies that principle: structured chaos, organized anarchy, meaningful absurdity.

### Kallisti

And remember, this golden apple of knowledge is inscribed with the word *Kallisti* — "to the prettiest one." But who is the prettiest? You decide. That's the whole point.

**Welcome aboard this Discordian journey. May chaos be ever in your favor.**

*All statements are true in some sense, false in some sense, meaningless in some sense, true and false in some sense, true and meaningless in some sense, false and meaningless in some sense, and true and false and meaningless in some sense.*
