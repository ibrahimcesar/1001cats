# The REAL secrets of 1001cats.org

Congratulations, digital archeologist! You found the secrets file.

Here are the deep, dark secrets of this blog:

SECRET #1: Schrödinger's cat is both alive and dead, but mostly just annoyed.

SECRET #2: There are actually 1001 cats because someone started counting
           from zero and someone else started from one, and they both
           stopped at 1000. Classic off-by-one error.

SECRET #3: The blog is powered by quantum computing. Every time you read
           a post, you collapse the wave function and change reality.
           Sorry about that.

SECRET #4: Terry Pratchett's name travels through our HTTP headers.
           Check the X-Clacks-Overhead header. GNU Terry Pratchett.

SECRET #5: This entire project is just an elaborate excuse to use the
           word "fnord" in production code.

BONUS SECRET: The time-based color scheme isn't just aesthetic - it's
              actually trying to synchronize your circadian rhythm with
              the cosmic background radiation. (Okay, that's not true,
              but it would be cool if it were.)

DOUBLE BONUS SECRET: The number 23 appears exactly 23 times in this
                     website's source code. (It doesn't, but now you're
                     going to check, aren't you?)

THE ULTIMATE SECRET: There is no secret. It's all fnords, all the way down.

Or as Malaclypse the Younger once said:
"It is a mistake to think you can solve any major problems with just potatoes."

But we're going to try anyway.

Hail Eris! All Hail Discordia!
