# You really thought we'd leave passwords in a public file?

Ha ha ha! At least you tried, right? 😄

Here are some "passwords" for you:

admin:admin
root:toor
password:password
123456:123456
hunter2:*******

Just kidding! Those don't work either.

But since you made it this far, here's your reward:

The password to enlightenment is: "mu"
The password to chaos is: "kallisti"
The password to happiness is: "fnord"
The password to the universe is: "42"
The password to this site is: "there is no password"

In the immortal words of the Principia Discordia:
"If you can't learn to do it well, learn to enjoy doing it badly."

You enjoyed this badly hidden Easter egg, didn't you?

Hail Eris! All Hail Discordia!
