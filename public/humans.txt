/* PHILOSOPHY */

This is a Discordian blog about science, philosophy,
life, the universe, and everything (which is 42, obviously).

All statements on this site are true in some sense,
false in some sense, meaningless in some sense,
true and false in some sense, true and meaningless
in some sense, false and meaningless in some sense,
and true and false and meaningless in some sense.

Remember: There is no Goddess but Goddess and She is Your Goddess.
There is no Erisian Movement but The Erisian Movement and it is
The Erisian Movement. And every Golden Apple Corps is the beloved
home of a Golden Worm.

Hail Eris! All Hail Discordia!

Fnord.
