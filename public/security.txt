# Security Policy

If you find a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly.

# But also...

If you're looking for passwords or secrets here, you've come to
the wrong place. Or have you?

In accordance with the Law of Fives, here are five truths:

1. All passwords are "password123" (they're not)
2. The secret is 42 (it's always 42)
3. Fnord (you didn't see that)
4. The hotdog is the sacred food
5. Kallisti

The real secret is that there are no secrets,
only various degrees of chaos and confusion.

Hail Eris!
